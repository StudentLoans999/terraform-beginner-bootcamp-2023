## Semantic Versioning :mage:

This project is going to utilize semantic versioning for its tagging.
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

The general format:

Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, eg. `1.0.1`

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

## Install the Terraform CLI

### Considerations with the Terraform CLI changes
The Terraform CLI installation instructions have changed due to gpg keyring changes. So we needed to refer to the latest install CLI instructions via Terraform Documentation and change the scripting for install.

[Install Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

### Considerations for Linux Distribution

This project is built against Ubuntu.
Please consider checking your Linux Dostribution and change accordingly to distribution needs.

[How to Check OS Version in Linux](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-check-os-version-in-linux-command-line/)

Example of checking OS Version:

```
$ cat /etc/os-release
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION_ID="22.04"
VERSION="22.04.3 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
VERSION_CODENAME=jammy
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
UBUNTU_CODENAME=jammy
```

### Refactoring into Bash Scripts

While fixing the Terraform CLI gpg depreciation issues we noticed that the bash scripts steps were a consdierable amount more code. So we decided to creat a bash script to install the Terraform CLI.

This bash script is located here: [./bin/install_terraform_cli](./bin/install_terraform_cli)

- Thiw will keep the Gitpod Task File ([].gitpod.yml](.gitpod.yml)) tidy.
- This will allow an easier time to debug and execute manually Terraform CLI install.
- This will allow better portability for other projects that need to install Terraform CLI.

### Shebang Considerations

A Shebang (pronounced Sha-bang) tells the bash script what program that will interpret the script. rg. `#!/bin/bash`

ChatGPT recommended this format for bash: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`

- for portability for different OS distributions
- will search the user's PATH for the bash executable

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)

### Execution Considerations
When executing the bash script we can use the `./` shorthand notation to execute the bash script.

eg. `./bin/install_terraform_cli`

If we are using a script in .gitpod.yml we need to point the script to a program to interpret it.

eg. `source ./bin/install_terraform_cli`

### Linux Permissions Considerations

In order to make our bash scripts executable we need to change the Linux permission for the fix to be executable at the user mode.

```sh
chmod u+x ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

alternatively:
```sh
chmod 744 ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod

### Github Lifecycle (Before, Init, Command)

We need to be careful when using the Init because it will not rerun if we restart an existing workspace.

https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks

## Working Env Vars

### env command

We can list out all Environment Variables (Env Vars) using the `env` command

We can filter specific env vars using grep eg. `env | grep AWS_`

### Setting and Unsetting Env Vars

In the terminal we can set using `export HELLO='world'`

In the terminal we unset using `unset HELLO`

We can set an env var temporarily when just running a command 

```sh
HELLO='world' ./bin/print_message
```

Within a bash script we can set env without writing export eg.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

HELLO='world'

echo $HELLO
```

### Printing Vars

We can print an env var using echo eg. `echo $HELLO`

### Scoping of Env Vars

When you open up new bash terminals in VSCode it will not be aware of env vars that you have set in another window.

If you want Env Vars to persist across all future bash terminals that are open you need to set env vars in your bash profile. eg `/bash_profile`

### Persisting Env Vars in Gitpod

We can persist env vars into gitpod by storing them in Gitpod Secrets Storage.

```
gp env HELLO='world'
```

All future workspaces launched will set the env vars for all bash terminals opened in those workspaces.

You can also set env vars in the `.gitpod.yml` but this can only contain non-sensitive env vars.

## AWS CLI Installation

AWS CLI is installed for the project via the bash script [`./bin/install_aws_cli`](./bin/install_aws_cli)

[Getting Started Install (AWS CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

[AWS CLI Env Vars](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)

We can check if our AWS credentials is configured correctly by running the following AWS CLI command:

```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

IF it is successful you should see a json payload return that looks like this:

```json
{
    "UserId": "AIDGTMXZIMEX3BEUMTBUS",
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/terraform-beginner-bootcamp"
}
```

We'll need to generate AWS CLI credentials from IAM User in order to use the AWS CLI.

## Terraform Basics

### Terraform Registry

Terraform sources their providers and modules from the Terraform registry which located at [registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io/)

- **Providers** is an interfact to APIs that will allow to create resources in terraform.
- **Modules** are a way to make large amount of terraform code modular, portable, and shareable.

[Random Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random)

### Terraform Console

We can see a list of all the Terraform commands by simply typing `terraform`

### Terraform Init

At the start of a new terraform project we will run `terraform init` to download the binaries for the terraform providers that we'll use in this project.

### Terraform Plan

`terraform plan`

This will generate out a changeset, about the state of our infrastructure and what will be changed.

We can output this changeset ie. "plan" to be passed to an apply, but often you can just ignore outputting.

### Terraform Apply

`terraform apply`

This will run a plan and pass the changeset to be executed by terraform. Apply should prompt yes or no.

If we want to automatically approve an apply we can provide the auto approve flag eg. ` terraform apply --auto=approve`

### Terraform Destroy

`terraform destroy`
This will destroy resources.

You can also use the auto approve flag to skip the approval prompt eg. `terraform destroy --auto-approve`

### Terraform Lock Files

`.terraform.lock.hcl` contains the locked versioning for the providers or modules that should be used with this project.

The Terraform Lock File **should be committed** to your Version Control System (VSC) eg. Github

### Terraform State Files

`.terraform.tfstate` contains information about the current state of your infrastructure.

This file **should not be committed** to your VCS.

This file can contain sensitive data.

If you lose this file, you lose knowing the state of your infrastructure.

`.terraform.tfstate.backup` is the previous state file state.

### Terraform Directory

`.terraform` directory contains binaries of terraform providers.

## AWS S3 Terraform

### AWS S3 Bucket Naming

We had to change the parameters in the bucket_name resouce in [main.tf](main.tf) to only have lowercase letters (also increased the length just to make sure the name was globally unique).

## Launching Terraform Cloud integration with CLI-driven workflow

Created a Workspace in [app.terraform.io](https://app.terraform.io/app/david_richey/workspaces/terra-house-1) and followed the steps in the CLI-driven runs section by editing the [main.tf](main.tf)

## Issues with Terraform Cloud Login and Gitpod Workspace

When attempting to run `terraform login` it will launch bash in a winswig view to generate a token. However it does not work as expected in Gitpod VSCode in the browser.

The workaround is to manually generate a token in Terraform Cloud
```
https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens?source=terraform-login
```

Then create and open the file manually here:

```sh
touch /home/gitpod/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json
open /home/gitpod/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json
```

Provide the following code (replace your token in the file):

```json
{
  "credentials": {
    "app.terraform.io": {
      "token": "YOUR-TERRAFORM-CLOUD-TOKEN"
    }
  }
}
```

We have automated this workaround with the following bash script [bin/generate_tfrc_credentials](bin/generate_tfrc_credentials)

## TF alias for Terraform

Set an alias for terraform to be tf in our bash profile.

`open ~/.bash_profile` in console
`alias tf="terraform"` in the opened file

Then created this bash script to make sure it is always set [set_tf_alias]([set_tf_alias])

Edited [.gitpod.yml](.gitpod.yml) to have `source ./bin/set_tf_alias` in both bash environemnts
